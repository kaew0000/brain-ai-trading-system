# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased] — V16 Phase 2A: Portfolio Intelligence Core

### Added
- **Portfolio Intelligence Core** (`portfolio/`): `portfolio_models.py`
  (dataclasses), `portfolio_state.py` (in-memory position/capital/risk
  tracker, no exchange calls), `correlation_engine.py` (tier-based
  correlation lookup against `config/correlation_table.py`),
  `capital_manager.py` (`CapitalManager.decide()` — the decision engine:
  ranked candidates + `RiskEngine` + `PortfolioState` → `PortfolioDecision`).
  Decision-only — does not execute trades, place orders, or call Binance.
  New `PORTFOLIO_*` settings (`config/settings.py`), all with defaults
  matching `PortfolioLimits`' own dataclass defaults.
- `RankedOpportunity.coverage` (`ranking/ranking_models.py`): additive
  field, default `1.0`, backward compatible. Previously computed by
  `confidence_fusion.fuse()` and discarded after use in a log string;
  now stored and used by `capital_manager.py` in place of the
  structurally-unavailable "AI Confidence" factor.
- 81 new tests (`test_portfolio_models.py`, `test_portfolio_state.py`,
  `test_correlation_engine.py`, `test_capital_manager.py`). Full suite:
  1001 → 1082 passed, 0 failed.
- `docs/architecture.md` §17 (design rationale) and §18 (next up).

### Not included (see architecture.md §17/§18)
- `portfolio/portfolio_manager.py` (orchestrator), Sector Engine, REST/
  WebSocket/Dashboard, execution wiring, `RiskEngine` per-symbol/
  aggregate exposure awareness. All explicitly out of scope for this
  phase.

## [V16.5] — Patch consolidation merge (this repository)

Merged ten development-phase bundles into one tree. See
`MERGE_REPORT.md` for full detail. Summary of functional changes
relative to the pre-merge `Brain_Bot_RUN` baseline:

### Added
- **Dashboard API authentication** (P1-A): bearer-token auth
  (`api/auth.py`), `API_AUTH_ENABLED` / `API_KEYS` / `JWT_SECRET`
  settings, off by default.
- **Dynamic, volatility-aware risk sizing** (P1-B1): risk-per-trade and
  leverage calculation moved from `agents/risk_manager.py` into
  `risk/risk_engine.py` (`get_leverage`, `_volatility_factor`), now
  reacting to ATR-normalized volatility, not just consecutive-loss
  streaks.
- **Multi-symbol foundation** (P1-C): `Settings.symbol_list` /
  `SYMBOLS` env var — architecture-only, falls back to the existing
  single-`SYMBOL` behavior when unset, so no deployment is affected
  unless explicitly opted in.
- **Market Scanner** (V16 Phase 2 Part 1): `scanner/market_scanner.py`,
  wired into `main.py`, gated behind `SCANNER_ENABLED` (default off).
  New `scanner_snapshots` table.
- **Opportunity Ranking Engine** (V16 Phase 2 Part 2): `ranking/`
  package (composite scoring across trend/momentum/volume/funding/
  liquidity/risk/AI-confidence/historical-performance factors). New
  `ranking_history` table. Not yet wired to a consumer — see
  `ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md`.
- **Watchdog supervision**: `system_health/watchdog.py` gains
  `WatchdogSupervisor`, paired with `systemd`'s `Type=notify` +
  `WatchdogSec=30` in `deployment/systemd/brain_bot.service`.
- Duplicate-order-id protection in `execution/trade_manager.py`
  (`_is_duplicate_order_error`, `new_client_order_id`).
- `PyJWT` added to `requirements.txt` (dashboard auth dependency).

### Fixed
- `/paper_trades` API endpoint returns `200` with `enabled: false`
  instead of `503` when the paper engine isn't running, so the
  dashboard renders a clean empty state instead of an error
  (previously shipped as a loose, unapplied `.patch` file — now
  confirmed applied and the stray patch file removed).

### Changed
- `agents/risk_manager.py`: risk-percentage calculation delegated to
  `RiskEngine` rather than computed locally (see Added, dynamic risk).

### Repository hygiene
- Removed dead patch artifacts (`findstr`, `uvicorn.txt`,
  `paper_metrics_503_fix.patch`, a stray brace-expansion-named empty
  directory) — see `CLEANUP_REPORT.md`.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + test + advisory
  `pip-audit`) and `release.yml`.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`.

Earlier history is described in `docs/V16_AUDIT_REPORT.md`,
`docs/V16_PHASE1_MULTISYMBOL_MIGRATION.md`, and `reports/` (V14/V15-era
audits), carried over unchanged by this merge.
